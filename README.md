## 📚 Covered Concepts

This project explores foundational features of React, including:

1. **Destructuring Props**  
   Cleanly extract props in functional components.

2. **Passing Arrays and Objects via Props**  
   Learn how to pass structured data to child components.

3. **Rendering Lists in React**  
   Use `.map()` to dynamically render lists from arrays.

4. **Component Composition**  
   Nest components within others to build modular UIs.

5. **Conditional Rendering**  
   Show or hide UI elements based on logic.

6. **Element & State Variables**  
   Understand how `useState` works and how to use element variables.

7. **Conditionally Rendering Lists**  
   Dynamically filter and render lists based on conditions.

8. **Event Handling**  
   Respond to user actions like clicks and form inputs.

9. **State vs Props**  
   Differentiate between internal state and received props.
